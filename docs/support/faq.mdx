## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Common Error Codes">
  Common error codes and solutions:
  
  - **401**: Invalid API key
  - **403**: Permission denied
  - **429**: Rate limit exceeded
  - **500**: Server error
  - **504**: Timeout
  
  See our [Error Handling](/api-reference/errors) guide for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is my request timing out?">
  Timeouts can occur for several reasons: 1. **Slow Website**: - Increase timeout: `"timeout": 30000` - Use `wait_until:
  "networkidle0"` 2. **Complex JavaScript**: - Enable JS: `"javascript": true` - Add wait time: `"wait_time": 5000` 3.
  **Large Pages**: - Use selective extraction - Implement pagination
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Content not being extracted correctly?">
  Try these troubleshooting steps: 1. **Check Selectors**: - Use browser dev tools to verify - Try multiple selector
  options 2. **JavaScript Content**: - Enable JS execution - Add appropriate wait conditions 3. **Dynamic Content**: -
  Use `wait_for` with specific elements - Implement retry logic
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Getting blocked by websites?">
  If you're getting blocked:
  
  1. **Implement Delays**:
     ```json
     {
       "delay": {

         "max": 5000
       }
     }
     ```
  
  2. **Rotate User Agents**:
